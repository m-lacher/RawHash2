# RawHash2
RawHash2 is an algorithm designed by ETH for realtime nanopore sequencing.
In a semester project I implemented a statistical U-test instead of the currently used T-test to evaluate its performance in detecting so called "events" in the raw singal.

This repository only contains my [final presentation](/Presentation_M.Lacher.pdf), as a reference of my work. I implemented the U-test in C code and tested it on a server cluster with different datasets to measure the performance.
The results where plotted in python.
